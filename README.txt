# SENtence Transformer-based data Imputation (SENT-I)

We propose a novel and innovative data imputation technique called Sentence Transformer-based Imputation (SENT-I).
 SENT-I leverages advanced indexing techniques to perform quick and accurate similarity searches, powered by 
state-of-the-art sentence transformer models. This approach is designed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency 
of data imputation tasks, providing a robust solution for handling missing data.


#Solver for Entity Resolution (SolvER)
We present Sentence Transformer-based Solver for Entity Resolution (SolvER), an algorithm specifically designed 
to address the Entity Resolution (ER) task in the context of data imputation. SolvER utilizes sentence transformer 
models to accurately identify and resolve entities, providing an effective solution for improving data quality and 
consistency.
